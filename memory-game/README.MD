###How The Game Works
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The rules are simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

###The Process

At first I was going to approach this like I did the pixel art maker project where I created a bunch of clickable elements. 

Then I came across this [Kahn Academy walk-through](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming-games-visualizations/memory-game/a/grid-of-tiles) that suggests using object oriented principles for this project.
